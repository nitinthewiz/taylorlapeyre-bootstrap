        <a href=""><h4>The Native Twitter Clients Really Aren’t That Bad</h4></a>
        <p>
          Today, Tapbots decided to pull the Alpha of Tweetbot for Mac from their website due to the restrictions that Twitter has recently put on third party clients. Now, I’d just like to say that I am a long-time user of all of Tapbots’ products. That being said,  I couldn’t tell you how many times I’ve read that the native Twitter clients are “unusable” or that Tweetbot makes using the default Twitter client a horrible experience. I’ve been using Tweetbot for quite a while, and when I first read people talking like this, I went to use Twitter’s clients to see for myself.

          I don’t think that Twitter is heading in the right direction with the new API changes, but that doesn’t mean that we should claim that their very well-made apps are any worse than they actually are.

          A fantastic quote from a fantastic designer. The <a href="">Nokia Lumia</a> phones look stunning, and I hope that Nokia gets their chance to shine here. Bravo.

          After a very, very long wait, <a href="">Cultured Code</a> has finally released a brand new version of its successful and awesome task management app, <a href="">Things</a>. I’ve always been very impressed by Cultred Code’s asthetic and Apple-esque attention to detail. Eveything seems very considered and subtle, and the result is an incredibly usable app that refuses to get in your way. Things 2 improves upon that concept, adding new subtle features and new considered details. Definitely check it out if you haven’t already.
